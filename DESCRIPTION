Description: Flexibly specify and fit Bayesian statistical models for epidemics. 'epidemia' leverages Rs formula interface so 
    that users can parameterize reproduction numbers and ascertainment rates in terms of predictors. Infections are propagated over 
    time using self-exciting point processes. Multiple regions can be modeled simultaneously with multilevel models. The design of the 
    package has been inspired by, and has borrowed from, 'rstanarm'. 'rstan' is used as the back end for fitting models.
